          csv_info: "Currently commas are accepted as separator exclusively. The format is specified as follows: Each line contains one question. The first column specifies the type of the question (single, multi, number, match, order, category or text). Column two contains the text of the question. Column three gives the tags of the question, separated by semicolon. Column four consists of numbers, that are seperated by semicolons, where these numbers stand for the correct answer options. (e.g. 1;3;5). If it's a text question, this column holds the limitations for the numbers of answers to give (1 for one, 3 for up to three). For all other question types this fourth column is empty. In each of the following columns is an answer option. In case of match questions, only the correct pairings are given, whereby a pair is seperated by ' - '. In the case order questions, at first there's the position, then a closing bracket and then the word, e.g. '1) Tree'. In the case of category questions, at first there's the category followed by three bars and then the semicolon-seperated word, e.g. 'Trees|||Maple;Chestnut;Palm'."
